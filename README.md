# Wyrm
Caenorhabditis Elegans (c. elegans) connectome simulation in Unity.

## Open Projects
Using the simulated neurons of the C.Elegans, we aim to use it for several demonstrative projects:

- C.Elegans in your smartphone: a 2D simulation where the nematode can move freely using its roughly-simulated body muscles and sensors.
- Starcraft 2 ultralisk controlled by C.Elegans connectome. Because it's fun
- Chess-wyrm: In this project we see if a simple chess AI could be developed using the connectome of the nematode.
